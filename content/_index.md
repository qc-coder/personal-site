I am a quantum hardware physicist specializing in superconducting quantum processors, with more than a decade of hands-on experience across circuit design, nanofabrication, cryogenic systems, and quantum measurement.

My work focuses on a central challenge in quantum computing: building processors whose reliability is rooted in their physical design — not sustained by increasingly complex layers of control and correction. I have spent my career translating fundamental circuit QED research into practical, scalable hardware, working at the interface between academic physics and industrial engineering.

I am currently based in **Paris, France**, where I am founding **Apex Qubits**, a company dedicated to developing high-coherence superconducting quantum processors for civil and public-domain applications.

## Experience

Over the past ten years, I have contributed to and led hardware programs in both academia and industry.

At **IQM Quantum Computers (Finland)**, I worked as a QPU design engineer and initiated and led a large-scale coherence improvement program involving more than 15 researchers. I developed CAD blueprints for IQM’s superconducting QPU chips and was responsible for processor-level layout and design choices impacting coherence and scalability. Under my technical leadership, qubit relaxation times (T₁) were improved by more than an order of magnitude. I worked across design, simulation, nanofabrication, and measurement teams to identify dominant loss mechanisms, optimize layouts using Energy Participation Ratio (EPR) methods, and translate these improvements into robust, reproducible fabrication processes.

At **Alice & Bob (Paris)**, I worked as a Staff Quantum Experimentalist, focusing on improving the experimental environment of superconducting qubits. My work included characterization of low-frequency magnetic noise, microwave radiation temperature, and laboratory-level disturbances, as well as the design of monitoring tools to ensure long-term experimental stability and repeatability.

I completed my PhD at **CNRS Institut Néel (Université Grenoble Alpes)**, where I developed nonlinear readout schemes for transmon qubits and optimized device designs that significantly improved coherence and readout fidelity. This doctoral work forms the experimental foundation of my current entrepreneurial project.

## Current Focus

My work focuses on developing superconducting quantum processors with reliability built into the physical design. The emphasis is on architectures where coherence, frequency stability, and resistance to noise are handled directly in the device and processor layout, rather than corrected later through increasingly complex control or error-mitigation methods.

This approach is shaped by more than a decade of hands-on experimental work in superconducting circuits and quantum measurement, leading to the view that scalable quantum systems must be strong by design, repeatable in fabrication, and stable across operating conditions.

I am currently building a quantum hardware startup with the goal of enabling quantum advantage and going beyond it, by turning experimentally proven physical insights into scalable, processor-level engineering.
